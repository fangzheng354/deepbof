Experiment code use in the paper, “A deep bag-of-features model for music auto-tagging” by Juhan Nam, Jorge Herrera and Kyogu Lee

Run the following scripts to run the whole pipeline:

step1) process_tagatune_audio.m: preprocessing mp3 data
step2) run_tagatune_unsup.m: unsupervised learning from local feature learning to song-level pretraining for DNN  
step3) run_tagatine_dnn.m: supervised learning using DNN
